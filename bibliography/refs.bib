abstract = {We report the discovery of K2-98 b (EPIC 211391664 b), a transiting Neptune-sized planet monitored by the K2 mission during its campaign 5. We combine the K2 time-series data with ground-based photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations to confirm the planetary nature of the object and derive its mass, radius, and orbital parameters. K2-98 b is a warm Neptune-like planet in a 10-day orbit around a V=12.2$\sim$mag F-type star with $M_\star$=$ 1.074\pm0.042$, $R_\star$=$ 1.311 ^{+ 0.083} _{ - 0.048} $, and age of $5.2_{-1.0}^{+1.2}$$\sim$Gyr. We derive a planetary mass and radius of $M_\mathrm{p}$=$ 32.2 \pm 8.1 $ and $R_\mathrm{p}$=$4.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$. K2-98 b joins the relatively small group of Neptune-sized planets whose both mass and radius have been derived with a precision better than 25 %. We estimate that the planet will be engulfed by its host star in $\sim$3$\sim$Gyr, due to the evolution of the latter towards the red giant branch.},

abstract = {We announce the discovery of EPIC218916923 b, a transiting warm-Jupiter ($T_\mathrm{eq}$=555$\pm$11 K) on a 29-day orbit around an active (log$R^\prime_\mathrm{HK}$ = $-$4.49 $\pm$ 0.03) K0 V star in K2 Campaign 7. We derive the system's parameters by combining the K2 photometry with ground-based follow-up observations. With a mass of $M_\mathrm{p}=0.381 \pm 0.045 M_{\rm Jup}$ and radius of $R_\mathrm{p}= 0.812 \pm 0.030 R_{\rm Jup}$, EPIC218916923 b is one of the transiting warm Jupiters with the lowest mass known to date. The planetary mean density $\rho_\mathrm{p} = 0.88 \pm 0.14 {\rm g\,cm^{-3}}$ can be explained with a core of $\sim 50 M_\oplus$. Given the brightness of the host star ($V$= 11.653 mag), the relatively short transit duration ($\sim$5 hours), and the expected amplitude of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect ($\sim$25 ms), EPIC218916923 is an ideal target to measure the spin-orbit angle of a planetary system hosting a warm Jupiter.},
