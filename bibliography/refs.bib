abstract = {We have conducted three-dimensional self-gravitating radiation hydrodynamical models of gas accretion on to high-mass cores (15-33 M⊕) over hundreds of orbits. Of these models, one case accretes more than a third of a Jupiter mass of gas, before eventually undergoing a hydrodynamic collapse. This collapse causes the density near the core to increase by more than an order of magnitude, and the outer envelope to evolve into a circumplanetary disc. A small reduction in the mass within the Hill radius (RH) accompanies this collapse as a shock propagates outwards. This collapse leads to a new hydrostatic equilibrium for the protoplanetary envelope, at which point 97 per cent of the mass contained within the Hill radius is within the inner 0.03RH which had previously contained less than 40 per cent. Following this collapse the protoplanet resumes accretion at its prior rate. The net flow of mass towards this dense protoplanet is predominantly from high latitudes, whilst at the outer edge of the circumplanetary disc there is net outflow of gas along the midplane. We also find a turnover of gas deep within the bound envelope that may be caused by the establishment of convection cells.},

abstract = {We investigate the properties of circumplanetary discs formed in three-dimensional, self-gravitating radiation hydrodynamical models of gas accretion by protoplanets. We determine disc sizes, scaleheights, and density and temperature profiles for different protoplanet masses, in solar nebulae of differing grain opacities.  We find that the analytical prediction of circumplanetary disc radii in an evacuated gap (RHill/3) from Quillen \&amp; Trilling yields a good estimate for discs formed by high-mass protoplanets. The radial density profiles of the circumplanetary discs may be described by power laws between r-2 and r-3/2. We find no evidence for the ring-like density enhancements that have been found in some previous models of circumplanetary discs. Temperature profiles follow a \~{} r-7/10 power law regardless of protoplanet mass or nebula grain opacity. The discs invariably have large scaleheights (H/r \&gt; 0.2), making them thick in comparison with their encompassing circumstellar discs, and they show no flaring.},

@article{Bodenheimer1986,
abstract = {The evolution of the giant planets is calculated under the general hypothesis that the solid cores formed first, by accretion of small particles, and that these cores later gravitationally attracted their gaseous envelopes from the solar nebula. The evolution passes through the following phases. (1) Planetesimals accrete to form a core of rocky and icy material. (2) When the core mass has grown to a few tenths of an Earth mass, a gaseous envelope in hydrostatic equilibrium begins to form around the core. (3) The core and envelope continue to grow until the “critical” core mass is reached, beyond which point the envelope increases in mass much more rapidly than the core. (4) The envelope mass increases quickly to its present value and prodices a relatively high luminosity, derived from gravitational contraction. (5) Accretion of both core and envelope terminates, and the planet contracts and cools to its present state on a time scale of 5 × 109 years. Evolutionary calculations of phases (2) through (5) are presented, based on solutions of the time-dependent stellar structure equations in spherical symmetry. The physical considerations that determine the critical core mass are discussed; its value is found to depend strongly on the core accretion rate but only weakly on surface boundary conditions. Evolutionary tracks up to the present state are presented for objects of Uranus and Saturn mass.},

@article{Durisen2006,
abstract = {Protoplanetary gas disks are likely to experience gravitational instabilites (GI's) during some phase of their evolution. Density perturbations in an unstable disk grow on a dynamic time scale into spiral arms that produce efficient outward transfer of angular momentum and inward transfer of mass through gravitational torques. In a cool disk with rapid enough cooling, the spiral arms in an unstable disk form self-gravitating clumps. Whether gas giant protoplanets can form by such a disk instability process is the primary question addressed by this review. We discuss the wide range of calculations undertaken by ourselves and others using various numerical techniques, and we report preliminary results from a large multi-code collaboration. Additional topics include -- triggering mechanisms for GI's, disk heating and cooling, orbital survival of dense clumps, interactions of solids with GI-driven waves and shocks, and hybrid scenarios where GI's facilitate core accretion. The review ends with a discussion of how well disk instability and core accretion fare in meeting observational constraints.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of an embedded protoplanet in a circumstellar disk using the 3D-Radiation Hydro code TRAMP, and treat the thermodynamics of the gas properly in three dimensions. The primary interest of this work lies in the demonstration and testing of the numerical method. We show how far numerical parameters can influence the simulations of gap opening. We study a standard reference model under various numerical approximations. Then we compare the commonly used locally isothermal approximation to the radiation hydro simulation using an equation for the internal energy. Models with different treatments of the mass accretion process are compared. Often mass accumulates in the Roche lobe of the planet creating a hydrostatic atmosphere around the planet. The gravitational torques induced by the spiral pattern of the disk onto the planet are not strongly affected in the average magnitude, but the short time scale fluctuations are stronger in the radiation hydro models. An interesting result of this work lies in the analysis of the temperature structure around the planet. The most striking effect of treating the thermodynamics properly is the formation of a hot pressure-supported bubble around the planet with a pressure scale height of H/R ≈ 0.5 rather than a thin Keplerian circumplanetary accretion disk.},

@article{Masset2000,
abstract = {We present an efficient and simple modification of the standard transport algorithm used in explicit eulerian fixed polar grid codes, aimed at getting rid of the average azimuthal velocity when applying the Courant condition. This results in a much larger timestep then the usual procedure, and it is particularly well-suited to the description of a Keplerian disk where one is traditionally limited by the very demanding Courant condition on the fast orbital motion at the inner boundary. In this modified algorithm, the timestep is limited by the perturbed velocity and by the shear arising from the differential rotation. FARGO stands for ``Fast Advection in Rotating Gaseous Objects''. The speed-up resulting from the use of the FARGO algorithm is problem dependent. In the example presented here, which shows the evolution of a Jupiter sized protoplanet embedded in a minimum mass protoplanetary nebula, the FARGO algorithm is about an order of magnitude faster than a traditional transport scheme, with a much smaller numerical diffusivity.},

abstract = {We present global hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with mesh refinement of accreting planets embedded in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). The magnetized disk includes Ohmic resistivity that depends on the overlying mass column, leading to turbulent surface layers and a dead zone near the midplane. The main results are: (i) The accretion flow in the Hill sphere is intrinsically 3D for hydrodynamic and MHD models. Net inflow toward the planet is dominated by high latitude flows. A circumplanetary disk (CPD) forms. Its midplane flows outward in a pattern whose details differ between models. (ii) Gap opening magnetically couples and ignites the dead zone near the planet, leading to stochastic accretion, a quasi-turbulent flow in the Hill sphere and a CPD whose structure displays high levels of variability. (iii) Advection of magnetized gas onto the rotating CPD generates helical fields that launch magnetocentrifugally driven outflows. During one specific epoch a highly collimated, one-sided jet is observed. (iv) The CPD's surface density \$\backslash sim30\{\backslash rm\backslash,g\backslash,cm\^{}\{-2\}\}\$, small enough for significant ionization and turbulence to develop. (v) The accretion rate onto the planet in the MHD simulation reaches a steady value \$8 \backslash times 10\^{}\{-3\} \{\backslash rm M\_\backslash oplus yr\^{}\{-1\}\}\$, and is similar in the viscous hydrodynamic runs. Our results suggest that gas accretion onto a forming giant planet within a magnetized PPD with dead zone allows rapid growth from Saturnian to Jovian masses. As well as being relevant for giant planet formation, these results have important implications for the formation of regular satellites around gas giant planets.},

abstract = {We investigate gas accretion flow onto a circumplanetary disk from a protoplanetary disk in detail by using high-resolution three-dimensional nested-grid hydrodynamic simulations, in order to provide a basis of formation processes of satellites around giant planets. Based on detailed analyses of gas accretion flow, we find that most of gas accretion onto circumplanetary disks occurs nearly vertically toward the disk surface from high altitude, which generates a shock surface at several scale heights of the circumplanetary disk. The gas that has passed through the shock surface moves inward because its specific angular momentum is smaller than that of the local Keplerian rotation, while gas near the midplane in the protoplanetary disk cannot accrete to the circumplanetary disk. Gas near the midplane within the planet's Hill sphere spirals outward and escapes from the Hill sphere through the two Lagrangian points L1 and L2. We also analyze fluxes of accreting mass and angular momentum in detail and find that the distributions of the fluxes onto the disk surface are well described by power-law functions and that a large fraction of gas accretion occurs at the outer region of the disk, i.e., at about 0.1 times the Hill radius. The nature of power-law functions indicates that, other than the outer edge, there is no specific radius where gas accretion is concentrated. These source functions of mass and angular momentum in the circumplanetary disk would provide us with useful constraints on the structure and evolution of the circumplanetary disk, which is important for satellite formation.},
